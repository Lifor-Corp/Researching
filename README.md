# Welcome to Lifor!

## What is Lifor?
Lifor is an application that would help you to organize your time.\
Basically, that is your daily schedule that would inform you:
- how many time is there for an activity to begin
- and how many time is there until an activity ends

You don't have to count time by yourself anymore. Lifor will count time for you.

## Target auditory
Our base auditory we see as **students** and **teachers** who must remember several things and activities they must accomplish.
For example, teacher must remember classroom where he (or she) must give a lecture in.
Students need to remember what subjects they have at certain day, when each of them starts and ends. That might be helpful for them if something would be able to handle this tasks for them.

They both can have this app to have their activities sheduled all in one place. We expect that this audience wants to see very simple interface that they can learn very fast. It might be helpful for them to introduce app features when they start it at first time. Otherwise they won't use it.

In future (when we add activity recommendations and together activity) our audience will grow and will not be limited on only students and teachers.

## Planned features
+ ### Plan your own activities
Add your events you need to track in app so Lifor can help you remember and optimaze your work.

+ ### Don't create routine events every time - Lifor will do it for you
If you shedule your classes so they repeat every week (or some period) there is no need to mention it in app every time you need to appear. Do it once and Lifor will take care of this kind of repeating events. Optimaze your routine activities with Lifor.

+ ### Tracking activities starting and ending time
The main feature our service provides. That will help you to track when your activities starts and ends (accurate to the second). 
That will make your life a little bit sheduled and organized. 
That is very helpful if you need to know when exactly an event starts or ends.

+ ### Together activities
Lifor will make an ecosystem (web service), where you can see not only your own activities but your friend's activities too.
Friends would be able to browse your activities for this current date so there will be better way to cooperate to hang out together.

Also there will be a way to make **together activities** in your friends group. **Togerther activities** is activities that you and your friends (of family) planned to do together. They would be able to be created at friends groups so everybody in this group can participate in.

+ ### Lifor event suggestion
What if Lifor will suggest user some activities on his free time (or probably suggest him to skip some activities to do something else).
It will make suggestions based on what he preferences or probably to make him try something new. It will make you cooperate with your friends and family or make new meeting.

For example, you have free time on Sunday and it suggests you a what movie to watch, or what consert to go, or some kind of event on the street you can take part in.
It will try to add some color in your life, will make you move out of your box.

That will be also a good way for companies to place an advertisement in. Their AD would be able to be shown to patentional customer based on his preferences.

+ ### Run app from anywhere
We plan to make Lifor a multiplatform application. You will be able to track and edit your activities from anywhere.

We plan to make it run on:

- Windows
- Linux
- Andriod
- IOS
- Web browsers (web app)
